## [Installation](./installation)

Goproject is written in Go and installation is as simple as downloading the binary from the [releases](https://github.com/jjunqueira/goproject/releases) page.
See the full [installation](./installation) guide for a step by step guide.

## [Configuration](./configuration)

The project is still in it's infancy so there isn't much to configure at the moment. The primary configuration a user would be interested in is a custom template.
